This plugin requires HTTP_Request2
https://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2/
Install with pear via "pear install HTTP_Request2"

--------

This plugin requires a patch (wpid.patch) until CO-530
(https://bugs.internet2.edu/jira/browse/CO-530) is resolved.
The patch will need to be applied each time the core
COmanage code is updated.

--------

To perform a "batch" load of records:

(1) Generate a list of member IDs (suitable for passing to GET /member/{id}),
    and place them in MlaSource/Config/full-sync-ids. There should be one id
    per line.

(2) Configure the plugin in "Full" Sync Mode.

(3) Manually run the 'syncorgsources' JobShell.
    https://spaces.internet2.edu/x/m4MQBg
    
    Note this will run for all configured org identity sources that are not
    in "Manual" Sync Mode. If you don't want that to happen, temporarily
    reconfigure them into "Manual" mode.
    
(4) After the job is complete, you may want to put the MLA source back into
    "Query" mode. If full-sync-ids isn't going to change often, doing this
    will save some overhead in reprocessing.
